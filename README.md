# uart-16550
This project implements a UART-16550 compatible design in SystemVerilog, including transmitter, receiver, register file, baud rate generator, and FIFO buffers. The design supports configurable word length, parity, stop bits, FIFO thresholds, and error detection, and is organized into modular RTL blocks for clarity and reuse.
